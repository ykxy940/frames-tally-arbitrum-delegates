# Tally API - Arbitrum DAO Delegates

This repository contains code submitted for the Tally API frames bounty - https://www.bountycaster.xyz/bounty/0x686411b7212b3efde9680dd8ee840a8fdee019e1

The frame allows users to browse through Arbitrum DAO members that are actively seeking delegations to become delegates in the Arbitrum DAO.

It relies on the simplest-frame repository - https://github.com/depatchedmode/simplest-frame/tree/main

The installation steps are outlined there.

Special mention to @encrypted-soul whose repository I found useful - https://github.com/encrypted-soul/frames-tally-proposals
